About Edward Ugarte
Edward Ugarte is a professional in applied econometrics, with a solid track record in the design of statistical simulations, empirical analysis, model formulation, and the development of educational resources for the quantitative study of economic phenomena. Throughout his career, he has integrated optimization tools, estimation techniques, and structural thinking to address complex economic problems from an analytical and practical perspective.
His approach combines technical rigor with a strong pedagogical calling, aiming to make econometrics understood through experimentation and empirical insight, not just through theoretical models. He has developed tools that allow users to explore estimator behavior under diverse conditions—such as violations of assumptions, nonlinear models, or dynamic systems—encouraging a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind every result.
Beyond simulation and estimation, Edward has contributed to the teaching and diffusion of applied optimization, particularly in contexts like welfare maximization, productive efficiency, and the calibration of quantitative models.
“Modeling is not just about representing reality; it's about choosing what to observe, how to measure it, and what we can learn from it.”
